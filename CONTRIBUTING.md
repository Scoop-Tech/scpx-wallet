## Coding Conventions
Nothing too rigid, start reading the code and you'll get the hang of it. Readability and conciseness is strongly prefered over verbosity.

Indent using four spaces!
Spaces after list items and method parameters ([1, 2, 3], not [1,2,3]), around operators (x += 1, not x+=1), and around hash arrows.
Comment with thought, chose names carefully.
Consistency is king.

## Submitting a Patch
Please start by opening a new issue describing the bug or feature you're intending to fix, and mention in the initial issue that you are planning to work on that bug or feature so that it can be assigned to you.

Follow the normal process of forking the project, and setup a new branch to work in. It's important that each group of changes be done in separate branches in order to ensure that a pull request only includes the commits related to that bug or feature.

Do your best to have well-formed commit messages for each change. This provides consistency throughout the project, and ensures that commit messages are able to be formatted properly by various git tools.

Finally, push the commits to your fork and submit a pull request.
